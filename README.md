### state Variable - super powerful variable.
to create the super powerful variable   we use React Hooks which is known has useState.


### React Hooks.

(React hooks is normal js utility function)
There two very imp hooks:

- useState() => use to generate a super powerful variable in React

// WE have to import this has a named import.

(import { useState } from "react"; )

- useEffect()
It will take two arguments
useEffect call back function is called when a body component is rendered

after Rendering the page suddenly the website will pop-up this is not  good way to write the code instead of that we can approach a two method that is we can add a Spinier to it or we can a shimmer Ui so that Using this website will look more attractive to the User who is using website.
### (means we will load a fake page until website will shown to the user)-Shimmer.
