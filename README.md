react is fast and efficient in Dom manipulation and it is a virtual Dom. so that react is fast .


when  ever state variable update react will re render my component. so it is called super powerfull.
 basically it is done by the the use state.

when ever we have to keep the UI layer and data layer consistent with each other here react will came into picture.

### React Hooks.

(React hooks is normal js utility function)
There two very imp hooks:

// WE have to import this has a named import.

(import { useState } from "react"; )
