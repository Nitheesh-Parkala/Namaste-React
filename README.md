## script
for start: 
### npx parcel index.html 
we can just write 
### npm run start or (npm start)

for production:
### npx parcel build index.html
we can just write 
### npm run build here only this cmd will work

### jsx
jsx-HTML-like or XML-like syntax

jsx (transpiled before it reaches to the JS engine. and it is done by parcel and it is a manger but it is done by the package called babel)

JSX=> React.createElement=>ReactElement-JS Object=>HTMLElement(render)-this all job done by the babel

when define classname in HTML we should write class but in JSX We should write in ClassName.

if we want write a jsx code in multiple line then we should wrap in (...) in this.round bracket Because babel need to understand.

### React Component.
Two Types:
Class Based Component.
Functional Based Component. //It is just a Javascript function. which returns the JSX code.
