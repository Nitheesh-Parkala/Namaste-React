 To Make Dynamic Card for Restaurant we should make use of props (props is nothing but a property it is nothing we can pass to the component) we know that  functional component is just a normal javascript function. and similarly [props] is just a normal argument to the function.

 ### Config driven UI. 
 Our Website id driven by config mainly it is done by the backend.

 Config-driven UI is a technique that allows you to create dynamic and customizable UIs without hard coding them. It uses a configuration file to define the layout and content of the UI components. This talk will cover the implementation of a smallest unit of component, such as a drop-down, form, or chart

 whenever we r doing maping  we have to give unique key over the functional component function.
 ### note: we should not use index as  a key.
 not using key(not acceptable)<<<<  index as key  <<<<<<<<<<<<<< unique id(best practice)
But  react never use index as a key it is a bad practice.
